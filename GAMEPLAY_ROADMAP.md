# Woodworking Tycoon - Comprehensive Gameplay Roadmap

## Core Game Vision

Woodworking Tycoon is an incremental/idle-inspired simulation game where players progress from amateur woodworkers with basic tools to master craftsmen capable of building a sailboat for retirement. The game emphasizes meaningful progression through tool acquisition, skill development, and increasingly complex projects.

**Key Design Principles:**
- More active than typical idle games, but with incremental progression satisfaction
- Linear commission sequence acts as primary progression driver
- Commissions are like "bosses" - high-reward milestone moments
- Manual operations (no automation initially)  
- Money as primary progression metric
- Each commission introduces one new element (tool, material, or technique)

## Early Game: Tutorial Phase (First 8-10 Commissions)

### Starting Conditions
- **Space**: Empty garage workshop
- **Equipment**: Single workspace
- **Materials**: One pallet on the ground
- **Money**: $0
- **UI Access**: Only main workshop view (no store or layout tabs)

### Tutorial Sequence (Commissions 1-2)
1. **Commission 1: First Shelf**
   - Break down pallet using workspace
   - Build basic pallet wood shelf
   - Complete first commission → receive payment (enough for miter saw)
   - **Unlocks**: Store tab access

2. **Commission 2: Precise Cuts**
   - Purchase miter saw from store
   - **Unlocks**: Layout tab (needed to place tools)
   - Place miter saw in workshop
   - Build project requiring precise cuts (picture frame?)
   - Complete second commission → receive improved payment
   - **Unlocks**: Free selling (at ~30% of commission prices)

### Early Tool Progression (Commissions 3-6)
3. **Commission 3: First Pine Project**
   - Introduces pine boards (better than pallet wood)
   - Project utilizing miter saw precision

4. **Commission 4: Width Control**
   - Requires table saw for ripping boards to width
   - Project needing specific board dimensions

5. **Commission 5: Smooth Surfaces**  
   - Requires lunchbox planer
   - Project emphasizing surface quality

6. **Commission 6: Complex Assembly**
   - Multi-component project using all acquired tools
   - Introduces more sophisticated joinery concepts

### Key Mechanics Introduced
- **Commission System**: Linear sequence, clear requirements, boss-like rewards
- **Tool Acquisition**: Store purchases unlock new capabilities  
- **Workshop Layout**: Strategic tool placement becomes important
- **Material Quality**: Progression from pallet wood to pine boards
- **Free Market**: Lower-profit alternative to commissions for grinding money

## Mid Game: Workshop Building Phase (Commissions 7-20)

### Expanding Capabilities
- **Tool Diversity**: Router, sanders, specialty tools
- **Material Variety**: Introduction of hardwoods (oak, maple, cherry)
- **Project Complexity**: Multi-step furniture pieces, advanced joinery
- **Workshop Efficiency**: Layout optimization becomes critical

### Major Milestones
- **First Hardwood Project**: Significant material cost investment
- **Shop Upgrade #1**: Garage → Hobby Shop (more space, better tools available)
- **Complex Furniture**: Moving beyond simple shelves to tables, cabinets
- **Technique Mastery**: Advanced operations requiring skill and precision

### Economic Complexity
- **Higher Stakes**: More expensive materials require careful planning
- **Investment Decisions**: Tool purchases vs. material inventory vs. shop upgrades
- **Risk Management**: Failed projects cost more than early game mistakes
- **Profit Optimization**: Understanding true costs and profit margins

## Late Game: Master Craftsman Phase (Commission 20+)

### Advanced Systems
- **Specialized Equipment**: Industrial-grade tools, finishing equipment
- **Premium Materials**: Exotic hardwoods, veneers, specialized hardware
- **Complex Projects**: Full furniture suites, architectural millwork
- **Shop Mastery**: Pro shop space with optimal workflow design

### Major Shop Progression
- **Hobby Shop → Pro Shop**: Maximum space, access to professional equipment
- **Workflow Optimization**: Efficient material flow and tool organization
- **Specialization Options**: Focus areas (furniture, cabinetry, artistic pieces)

## Endgame: Sailboat Project

### Ultimate Goal
- **Master Project**: Multi-part sailboat construction
- **New UI Tab**: Dedicated sailboat building interface
- **Complex Systems**: Requires mastery of all previous techniques and tools
- **Retirement Ending**: Complete the boat and sail away

### Sailboat Components (TBD)
- Hull construction
- Mast and rigging
- Interior finishing
- Hardware and systems

## Progression Systems

### Commission Progression
- **Linear Sequence**: Each commission builds on previous capabilities
- **Clear Requirements**: Players know what tools/materials they need
- **Escalating Complexity**: One new element per commission
- **Milestone Rewards**: Significant payment increases at key points

### Economic Progression  
- **Tool Investment Cycle**: Commission rewards → tool purchase → new capabilities
- **Material Quality Ladder**: Pallet wood → pine → hardwoods → exotics
- **Shop Expansion**: Garage ($X) → Hobby Shop ($Y) → Pro Shop ($Z)
- **Free Market**: Grinding option at reduced profitability

### Unlock System
- **Feature Unlocks**: Store tab, layout tab, free selling
- **Tool Requirements**: Higher-tier tools locked behind shop upgrades
- **Material Access**: Better materials unlock with reputation/progression
- **Technique Gates**: Complex operations require prerequisite tool mastery

## Key Gameplay Loops

### Primary Loop: Commission Fulfillment
1. Receive commission with clear requirements
2. Identify needed tools/materials not currently owned
3. Earn money through free selling or previous commissions
4. Purchase required equipment/materials
5. Place tools optimally in workshop layout
6. Execute project using acquired capabilities
7. Complete commission for major reward
8. Repeat with increased complexity

### Secondary Loop: Workshop Optimization
1. Acquire multiple tools creating layout challenges
2. Experiment with workshop arrangements
3. Optimize for material flow and efficiency
4. Upgrade to larger shop space when needed
5. Reorganize for new tools and workflows

### Economic Loop: Investment & Returns
1. Assess commission requirements vs. current capabilities
2. Calculate tool/material investment needed
3. Determine optimal earning strategy (free selling vs. saving)
4. Make strategic purchases
5. Utilize new capabilities for higher-value projects

## Balancing Considerations

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Learning Curve**: Gentle tutorial progression with clear success paths
- **Economic Pressure**: Meaningful but not frustrating resource constraints  
- **Complexity Growth**: Each commission adds manageable new complexity
- **Recovery Options**: Free selling provides fallback earning method

### Player Engagement
- **Big Moments**: Tool purchases, shop upgrades, complex commissions feel significant
- **Steady Progress**: Always clear next steps and achievable goals
- **Player Choice**: Layout decisions and earning strategy options
- **Long-term Vision**: Sailboat goal provides ultimate motivation

### Session Flexibility
- **Short Sessions**: Progress possible in 10-minute play periods
- **Long Sessions**: Deep engagement possible for hours-long sessions
- **Idle Elements**: Potential for passive progress in future updates
- **Save Continuity**: Single persistent game world
